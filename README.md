# Discounts-Programming-Challenge-in-Swift
Tried to code this challenge in my favorite programing language -> Swift


<h1>What is this challenge about? </h1> 


<p> This challenge caught my eyes couple of years ago when I noticed that "UNiDAYS" were looking for interns. Unfortunately, I didn't go so far with coding that time.</p> 
<p> I saw this repo on my github account and said that I have to give it a try anyway using Swift, it should be fun.</p>

<p>Eventhough I tried to respect the requirements of the challenge I allowed my self to do some changes as I didn't do this for interwiew but just for fun (a coding night with cup of coffee. Joking not just a cup :D). </p>

<p> The actual requirements of the challenge you may find it in <a href="https://github.com/MyUNiDAYS/tech-placement-challenge"> this github repository</a> </p>


<h2> What is next? </h2> 

<p> I am planning to clean a bit the code. I have used a macOS app project template to write the code for the challenge. Next step I want to create UI for an iOS app and use this challenge as my model. </p>
